Issues for IGVC circuits

general 
- add standoff's to all daughtercards
-make a custom gschem symbol for a 74LSO4 inverter (Low priority)
-reorganize repo (low priority)
-shrink fuse footprint
-buy blue leds
-buy 28 pin packages

backplane
-Widen all daughtercard innerconnects
-Widen Molex power 
-Shrink LRF Power Connector
-fet

-We need to rotate the ICSP pins on the backplane by 180 degrees
-remove LEDS for SigMux from backplane
-Revisit Pinout. I dont belive we need to be transfering GND and VCC between boards in so many places 

sigmux
need to move external LED hookup to before resistors. ground resistors after

estop
-label colors and direction for LEDS
-update footprint for OR gate (pads are not wide long enough

blinker
moved onboard LED indicator to after transistor. This allows the GD's to shine really bright
-label UC's
-fet
-autonomous blink is to slow
-need pull down on transistor to keep it a solid color when off



purchasing



COMPELTED

backplane
-Add connection from R-EDCS[18] to SigMux[8]
-Remove extra PWM Connectors
-change the relay/diode/transistor on the e-stop to be on the backplane. Just grab a signal from the E-Stop
-Flip-Flop RX 
-add power light
-move e-stop RX from [30] to [31]
-I2C is not consistent between devices
-updated transistors
-deleted pin 43 on edcs (ground) for i2c
-replace VIA's as holes for mounting

SigMux
-Fix EDCS-In pins to match Backplane ( pins[7:11] >> pins[2:6] )
-PIN 1 on the Shift Register for buttons isnt connected to pin 2 on uC (THis is the asynchronous parallel load input selector)
-RC Good/Bad LED is wrong
-"TO BLINKER BOARD" is not recieving autonomous signal, like it should be
-grab flashing light signal before the R's and D
-Updated transistors

E-Stop
-change the relay/diode/transistor setup to be on the backplane. Just grab a signal from the E-Stop
-change the estop power light to the other side
-RX in has been moved from [30] to [31]
